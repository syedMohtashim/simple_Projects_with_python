Nyuserre Ini was a pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, the sixth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. 
The younger son of Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II and the brother of the short-lived king Neferefre, 
Nyuserre probably lived in the second half of the 25th century BCE and reigned for more than two decades. 
He was succeeded by Menkauhor Kaiu, who could have been his nephew and a son of Neferefre. 
Nyuserre built three pyramids for himself and his queens and completed a further three for his father, 
mother and brother, all in the necropolis of Abusir. 
His temple dedicated to the sun god Ra was named Shesepibre or "Joy of the heart of Ra";
it is the largest such temple that survives from the Old Kingdom.
